# APK-Permission-Extractor
Takes permssions from APK files and saves them for future viewing 

REQUIRES APKTOOL https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/

How to use script:

Start by installing Apktool and Python 3

[1] Create a folder to store your apk files. The script generates a bunch of files so it is recommended this is a empty folder separate of other documents. 

[2] Download the script from the google doc directory and save it to your desktop (or anyplace you can find it easy).

[3] Copy the full directory name for the apk folder.

[4] Run the script and use the copied directory.

[5] Wait for the script to complete! .txt files will be generated for each apk file.
